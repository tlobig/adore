# ADORe System Requirements
**CPU:** Intel CORE i7 7700K or equivalent/better
  - The more cores you have, the more trajectory planners you can run in 
  parallel.
- No specific graphics card is required as everything (except plotting) runs on 
  the CPU

**RAM:** Min 8GB for execution. Compilation process is faster with 16+GB

**HDD storage**
  - at least 2.5 GB to clone the repository
  - at least 15 GB to build all necessary docker context

**Operating system:** 
  - Anything that supports newer docker versions. 
  - Recommended: Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04


**Network:**

  A reliable network with high throughput and low latency. Initial 
  build can take a significant amount of time to pull all necessary dependencies
  from apt and docker. A poor connection will result in non-deterministic build 
  failures. 

**Software**
  - Docker v20.10.17 or greater and docker compose v2.6.0 or greater. To install
  the latest docker and docker compose run the following command:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DLR-TS/adore_tools/master/tools/install_docker.sh | bash`. 
```
For more information review the official docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

**Make**

:warning: **Warning**: If you have a bad internet connection you will experience non-deterministic failures. Try running
'make cli' or 'make build' again.
